# PythonBowlingKata
Standard bowling kata for python

# Purpose
I use the bowling kata to learning new languages. It helps me to fix one side of the problem (the "business" side) so I can focus on learning the new ("language") side.  

The bowling kata is helpful because it provides clear opportunties to exerices the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle and exercises elements of the new language (class, method, loops, arrays (or lists)).  

This repository has a series of commits that reflect steps in the kata.  

## Kata
Kata is a term often found in Japanese martial arts. The English word "form" is analgous. The idea is a set of steps you practice to demonstrate a grasp of fundamentals, remind your mind of the flow of a thing, and to separate you from the world outside of practice and prepare for a new practice sesssion.  

Martin Fowler, among many others, have promoted the idea of "coding kata" for the same reason.  

# Prereqs
VS Code with Python Extension

# Set Up the first test
Open a new folder named bowlingkata (or something similar)
Create a new file named game_test.py -- the _test.py is important. This is what the Python unittest package uses to detect tests.
